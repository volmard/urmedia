					LG: WebOS

				</h2>          

        <p class="news-page__text">

          With the arrival of webOS in 2014 , LG's smart TV offering was completely refreshed. All LG smart TVs from 2014 and 2015 got webOS 2.0, and 2016 saw the release of webOS 3.0 via a firmware update.

        </p>

				<p class="news-page__text">

          That was then, but now you can expect to see webOS 3.5 here in 2017

        </p>

				<p class="news-page__text">

          Much like Samsung's Smart Hub, webOS3.5 is built around a taskbar that pops-up from the bottom of the screen.

        </p>

				<p class="news-page__text">

          Apps, whether a content hub like Netflix or simply a HDMI input on the TV, are treated the same, with a dynamically changing roster across the bottom of the screen. The app icons pop-up, they jig about, they drop-down, and they change order.

            It's fast – really fast – but locating something not on this Launcher Bar is actually very difficult. Nor is customising WebOS as easy as it could be.

					</p>

					<p class="news-page__text">

						Content-wise, it's pretty good, with only ITV Player and 4OD missing from a line-up that includes Netflix, Amazon Instant, the BBC iPlayer, YouTube, the underrated Blinkbox, Wuaki.tv and – exclusively – Sky's NOW TV.

          </p>

					<p class="news-page__text">

						For US folks there's your standard Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and Google Play TV and Movies, as well as Hulu, VUDU, MLB.TV, Spotify and FandangoNow.

          </p>

					<p class="news-page__text">

						There's a nice flicker panel for scrolling through 'live' sources and apps, and a Today panel across the middle of the screen that gives one-flick access to scrolling cover art for live TV programs and movies.

          </p>

					<p class="news-page__text">

						Dynamic, colourful, but often rather dizzying to use, WebOS is inconsistent in design and dynamics, and takes a while to get to know; all but the tech-savvy can find themselves baffled.

					Plasma vs LED vs LCD TVs

				</h2>          

        <p class="news-page__text">

          LEDs (which are basically the same thing as LCDs) are the biggest sellers. 

          Their picture quality is not as good as that of plasma TVs, but still good enough for nearly everyone. 

          They also offer greater practicability and they can get a lot brighter. 

          The majority of people should opt for an LED TV - especially if the TV will be located in a living room   with    a lot of windows.

        <label class="news-page__label" for="read_more_2">

          <span class="news-page__open-btn">Read More</span>

          <span class="news-page__close-btn"></span>

        </label>    

        <div class="news-page__extended-news">

          <p class="news-page__text"> 

            Plasma TVs have the best picture quality hands down, and are also cheaper. 

            However, they are not very bright, so they are only suitable for dark rooms. 

            They suffer from occasional but not permanent image retention and have a slight buzzing noise on bright    pictures. 

            Go for a plasma TV if you want no compromise on the picture quality and if it will not bother you each time    an image is retained for more than two minutes.

            To help you compare, the following table shows the major differences between a plasma and an LED television.

            Each difference is explained in greater detail in the next pages of this article.
